                    <h2>Our Certificates & Online Programs For 2023</h2>
                    <p>Student scientific work is an equally important component of the educational process, because there are future post-graduate students and scientists among the students
                         of higher education. And the best way to talk about your first scientific interests is to give presentations at such conferences and publications in various scientific
                          publications. In 2021, the graduates will produce 451 scientific articles, including 154 individual papers, and up to 1,075 theses at conferences, of which 564 are individual papers.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>Such efforts of our employees and students of education have been recognized with state awards, titles and prizes for scientific achievements: 34 students became prize winners in the II

                              <p>The university is open to the world, because it maintains close contacts not only with Ukrainian, but also with international partners through the conclusion of bilateral agreements. 
                                A total of 256 such contracts have been concluded, 68 of which are under Erasmus+ programs. During the reporting period, 125 employees of the University went on business trips abroad,
                                 and 96 students and graduate students used the right to academic international mobility.</p>
                                  <br>
                                  <p>The pride of Lviv University is the objects that constitute the national heritage: Herbarium, Collection of cultures of antibiotic-producing microorganisms, Collection of tropical
